The application of ML to predict the hardness of high entropy alloys (HEAs) has been advanced to streamline the traditionally complex and time-consuming empirical process. This study introduces a stacking regression model created from the top-performing algorithms, including Linear Regression (LR), Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree (DT), LightGBM (LGBM), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP Regressor), and ElasticNet. Enhanced by a Transformed Target Regressor, the model employs 20 thermodynamic, mismatch, and combination parameters (phase formation parameters) specifically for the Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni systems. It also incorporates 18 elements, enhancing the model's generalizability and realism in predicting hardness. Feature selection was performed using Pearson correlation coefficient (Pc) and Conditional Mutual Information-based Feature Selection (CMIFS) techniques. The impact of HEA composition and phase formation parameters on hardness was qualitatively analyzed using interpretable tools such as SHAP values and PDP plots. The stacking model demonstrated superior performance compared to individual models, achieving an overall RÂ² score of 0.88 for compositional parameters and 0.90 for phase formation parameters. Additionally, the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) was successfully employed to optimize HEA hardness, resulting in a significant increase in hardness. Finally, the model not only benefits from the generalization of ensemble learning but also provides valuable interpretability, showcasing its effectiveness in designing diverse HEA systems with high hardness.
